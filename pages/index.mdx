# Aknur Kassym

Sup, beautiful people. Welcome to my page. 

I am an international student from Kazakhstan studying CS & Economics @ [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). Deeply passionate about Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Startups and Venture Capital.

In my spare time I do calisthenics, read *The Information*, study macroeconomics, consume tons of podcasts and watch F1 highlights.

Exploring the world, people and myself.
